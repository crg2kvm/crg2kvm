I am a recent Computer Science graduate of the University of Virginia's Engineering School. I am currently seeking a full-time job in the data space, sftware or quantitative finance fields. I currently have two public repositories. The portfolio contains a variety of projects I have completed independently and throughout school there is more information in that repository. The CFB_bet repository is a project that I am currently working on where I am trying to predict whether the over/under and spreads hit on a college football game, there is also more information in that repository.
